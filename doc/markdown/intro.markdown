# Introduction

Caius is a functional testing framework written in object-oriented Tcl using
the [incr Tcl] extension. It provides intuitive, object-oriented programming 
interfaces to Expect and Selenium WebDriver.

The `caius` command line tool provides a generic test runner which allows you
to execute tests written in any programming language and test framework. The
integrated report generator collects test results and turns them into legible,
clean test reports.

# Installation

In order to install and try out Caius on your system, follow the instructions
in this section.

## Pre-requisites

Caius is developed and tested on Debian/GNU Linux but should run on other
Linux distributions without problems. Using Caius on BSD or other Unix-like
systems may require minor modifications.

Caius requires Tcl 8.6 or later with thread support and a recent version of
tcllib. In addition, the tdom package is required for results parsing and
report generation.
