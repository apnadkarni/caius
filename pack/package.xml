            <summary>a functional testing framework in object-oriented Tcl</summary>
            <p>
                Caius is a functional testing framework for the 21st century. It was
                born out of the need for a contemporary replacement for DejaGnu.
            </p>
            <p>
                Caius is written in object-oriented Tcl and provides easy-to-use
                programming interfaces to proven testing technologies. Through its
                versatile reporting system, Caius integrates well with modern CI
                systems and test management tools.
