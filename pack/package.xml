            <summary>a functional testing framework in object-oriented Tcl</summary>
            <p>
            Caius is a functional testing framework for the 21st century.
            It was born out of the need for a contemporary replacement for
            DejaGnu.
            </p>
            <p>
            Caius is written in object-oriented Tcl and provides easy-to-use
            programming interfaces to Selenium WebDriver and Expect. Through
            its extensible reporting system, Caius integrates well with
            modern CI systems and test management tools.
