        <summary>documentation for the testing framework Caius</summary>
        <p>
            Caius is a functional testing framework for the 21st century. It was
            born out of the need for a contemporary replacement for DejaGnu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Caius is written in object-oriented Tcl and provides easy-to-use
            programming interfaces to proven testing technologies. Through its
            versatile reporting system, Caius integrates well with modern CI
            systems and test management tools.
